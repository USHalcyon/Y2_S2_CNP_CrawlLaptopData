# Y2_S2_CNP_Crawler

This project is an assignment for the Computer Network course. It is a program that crawls data from computer sales websites, accessories, and more.

Currently, we only provide categories such as components, PCs, peripherals, laptops, and tablets. If you want to crawl additional types of data, you can modify the program to suit your needs.

To crawl the data, simply run the Crawler.py file, and the output files will be saved as json in the same directory.
